Sorry for posting this here, but I wasn't able to submit a propper issue on this. 

NeptuneRising's scraper is picking up VidUp servers which are apparently replacing all their disputed videos with "Rickroll" video clip to sabotage. Currently Neptune Rising doesn't have a feature to block/disable upload servers, they only block the websites that host the servers.  Please add such a feature or help find a way to disable VidUp. Thx
